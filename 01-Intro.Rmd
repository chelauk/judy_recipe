\vspace{1cm}

Judy you have always been keen on the art and craft of cookery and the enjoyment of meals together. Thanks to you, many of us are confident in the kitchen, whether it is taking on an ambitious creation or knocking something together from whatever is in the back of the cupboards.

# From Maria and Gertrude:

## Fried Fresh Fish (Tilapia) (Nsomba yo kazinga)
\vspace{1cm}
```{r, nsomba, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/tilapia.jpg")
```
 \vspace{1cm}

Ingredients:

Tilapia

Salt

Lemon slices for decorating (absolutely optional)

¼ cup of Cooking oil

Preparation:

Clean the fish by removing scales and innards. You can cut the heads off if so desired. Personally, the heads are the best part of the fish. If you decide to keep the heads, make sure to clean the inside and remove the gills.

Wash the fish and pat dry.

Make slits about the body and rub salt into it. 

Cooking Instructions:

Heat a pan with oil on the stove top

Put the fish in once the oil is hot. Reduce the heat to medium.

Depending on the size of the fish, cook it for 5/6 minutes on each side.

You'll know it's ready when it's golden brown.

You can serve this with some vegetables and nshima. Or, you can eat it as is with a beer for a snack. This is our favorite Lazy Friday dinner! (No beer for the kids though….)
