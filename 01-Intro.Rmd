### Fried Fresh Fish (Tilapia) (Nsomba yo kazinga)
\vspace{1cm}
```{r, nsomba, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/tilapia.jpg")
```

\vspace{1cm}

#### Ingredients:
\
Tilapia

Salt

Lemon slices for decorating (absolutely optional)

¼ cup of Cooking oil

#### Preparation:

Clean the fish by removing scales and innards. You can cut the heads off if so desired. Personally, the heads are the best part of the fish. If you decide to keep the heads, make sure to clean the inside and remove the gills.

Wash the fish and pat dry.

Make slits about the body and rub salt into it. 

Cooking Instructions:

Heat a pan with oil on the stove top

Put the fish in once the oil is hot. Reduce the heat to medium.

Depending on the size of the fish, cook it for 5/6 minutes on each side.

You'll know it's ready when it's golden brown.

You can serve this with some vegetables and nshima. Or, you can eat it as is with a beer for a snack. This is our favorite Lazy Friday dinner! (No beer for the kids though….)

### Fresh Turnip Greens

Once the oil is hot, lightly fry the onions. Then add the greens and tomatoes. Turn them and add about 2 pinches of salt. (Add one first and taste to see if you need a second pinch)

Add a little water (1/4 cup) and simmer. When the water finishes, slightly fry it and it should be ready. Cooking time varies according to the vegetable choice. This works best for turnip greens.

"Emere Yona" is an expression in Uganda to suggest 'a bit of everything'.
It's not very common in tourist areas and only a few restaurants will offer this. However, it's very common in local or traditional restaurants.

The variety of staple foods include a mix of all or many of the following: Posho (nshima), rice, sweet potato, pumpkin, yam, chapati, cassava, matooke and so on.

These are eaten with sauces (relishes) including binyebwa, beans, greens, nyamas (meats) and fish.

The food (carbohydrates) would go with a sauce, beans, some pasted fish, Luwombo, chicken or meats of some sort.
2 mins ago
Peanut sauce is called binyebwa, which is raw groundnuts ground into a paste and cooked as a sauce to add to fish, chicken or meat. This makes the pink colouring to the meal. This is a very special quality to Ugandan foods. 

The greens include nakati, sukuma wiki, cabbage, entula, katunkuma (small), eggplant, green pepper and so on.

Matooke (Musa acuminata) is a green banana used as a staple in cooking.

Luwombo is a stew steamed in banana leaves; it has been considered to be a very special dish that was/is served only to very important guests in Ugandan culture.

Nakati - Ethiopian Eggplant (Solanum aethiopicum). The leaves are a very popular green and delicious. 
Sukuma wiki (collard greens) is an East African dish cooked with onions and spices.
Entula (Solanum macrocarpon) is an African baby egg plant
Bitter Berries (Katunkuma) are also used as a green

## Fond memories: 

### Mac and cheese

Pilar, Robert, Isabel, Martha and I used to love mac and cheese day in Bedlinog during our Summer holiday visits. Judy would always use shell pasta as we would call it, or conchiglie as they call it in Italy. It was the simplest, most delicious pasta that I had ever tasted and not once have I or my family successfully replicated it. I have a distinct memory of picking up a recipe from grandma Judy, reading it out to mum and her saying "there's no way we are using a whole block of cheese" and realising, that's why it would never taste as good. The delicious, peppery, creamy and cheesy meal would fill you up for what you felt like might be an entire week. 

### Fruit salad afternoons

Every afternoon on our Summer visits to Bedlinog the cousins would sit and watch cbeebies, CBBC, nickolodeon or whatever we could find on the Children's section of sky tv, and eat grabdma Judy's great big shared plates of lovingly chopped up fruits: peach, nectarine, oranges, apples, bananas, pears or whatever was available from the local stores in Bedlinog at the time, which was amazing because each great big pile of fruit always looked so tropical and inviting. 

There's something so delicious about a shared plate, that increases the taste levels of your favourite when you're anxious someone else is going to grab the last piece!!

### 7 course meal

I distinctly remember the fanciest meal I have ever eaten - at the culinary school in Antequera with Judy. Now, I don't remember all the courses but I do remember the intensity of the rich flavours and how full and ready for a siesta I felt afterwards, after the endless courses kept coming and coming. There was an amazing seabass course with 2 different sauces: a white and a red wine sauce that was like nothing I've tasted before. 

### Fartons in Ronda and Churros in Antequera

We all know Abuela Judy for her delicious savoury meals, but we also sometimes enjoyed a sugary sweet treat together the tasty fartón for example - sugary sweet pastries in the beautiful town of Ronda, that I'd stared at on a painting of the famous Puente Nuevo bridge in the Bedlinog house. One visit to Antequera when I was around 9 or 10 I distinctly remember wanting to have churros con chocolate EVERY time I visited a cafe with Judy or my parents. I presumed it was a daily activity, a standard breakfast for the Spanish, and I relished the opportunity to compare the different textures, lengths and sizes of churros. I was fascinated by the new food and blissfully unaware of the concept of calories or fat content. Watching the lady freshly a few streets down from abuela's house ladel batter into a huge vat of oil outside her own home was nothing but exciting and appetising. I think everyone was so suprised at the amount I could eat for someone so small!

Whether it was apricot jam, croquetas at a bar and a catch up or chicken for two from the pollo place in Antequera, treat visits to the newsagents in Bedlinog for paper bags 
of pick and mix with Pilar, Robert, Isa and Martha, magdalenas in the morning, making pizza from scratch with cousins, angel delight, tapas or stew, food shared with abuela brings to life many beautiful moments and childhood memories shared. I know abuela Judy passed down her passion to food for more than just one of her grandchildren, and I am ever grateful for that.

I may include my lasagne recipe which has a story attached.  I was very proudly making this for your gran and granddad the first time they visited us just after we got married.  I was so well prepared I had it made and in the freezer.  Forgot to bring it out on time so, at best, the lasagne was served lukewarm!  Yet being kindly parents-in-law, they said it was lovely! Not my best effort!!
