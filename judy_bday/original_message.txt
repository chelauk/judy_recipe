Dear all,

As you may or may not know, Judy is approaching a landmark birthday.  While I was thinking of something do for her, the idea occured to me that she's always been keen on cookery and also thanks to her I feel fairly confident in the kitchen to knock something together from whatever is in the cupboards.  So I thought it might be quite fun to put together a recipe book compiled from her friends and family.  I thought for instance I would put in a dish with made with anchovies, chillies and tomatoes with spaghetti which I often have when the larder is looking empty. I would contribute this recipe combined with perhaps a picture  Stanley in the kitchen showing that her legacy continues.  So in summary it would be nice to collect from everyone on this list a recipe and perhaps an image or failing that maybe just a message.

I apologise in advance, you may recieve this message more than once, obviously also feel free to ignore this message.  I will include a list of names at the bottom of this that I have sent this message to, the list of phone numbers I actually have is pretty sparse so I am relying on people forwarding this.  I am also using the 'broadcast' facility on whatsapp, this means that replies will come to me only, not to everyone I have sent the message to.

 If you do forward the message, please add to the list to avoid too much duplication.


I will collate the messages/images and stick them in a book in time for Judy's birthday. Please return the recipes/images and messages to chelauk@yahoo.co.uk | +39 3287544787 | +44 7906262349 by the end of September if possible.
Many many thanks in advance 
Love
Chela
