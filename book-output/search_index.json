You can cut the heads off if so desired. Personally, the heads are the best part of the fish. If you decide to keep the heads, make sure to clean the inside and remove the gills. Wash the fish and pat dry. Make slits about the body and rub salt into it. Cooking Instructions: Heat a pan with oil on the stove top Put the fish in once the oil is hot. Reduce the heat to medium. Depending on the size of the fish, cook it for 5/6 minutes on each side. You’ll know it’s ready when it’s golden brown. You can serve this with some vegetables and nshima. Or, you can eat it as is with a beer for a snack. This is our favorite Lazy Friday dinner! (No beer for the kids though….) 2.1 Fresh Turnip Greens Most meals are not complete with a vegetable accompaniment. So here goes: ### Ingredients: 2 bunches of turnip greens (You can use any leafy greens such as collard greens, mustard greens, Swiss chard or spinach).

Wash the onion and tomato and chop them into cubes. 2.1.1 Cooking Instructions: Put a pan on the stove top on medium heat. Put some oil (3 table spoons) in it to heat.
